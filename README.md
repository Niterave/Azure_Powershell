I try to write all of my scripts so all the script user needs to do is fill in the variables and then run the script with no further edits needed.  I also try to name my scripts with descriptive enough names of what they do that they're easy to pick from the list.

Add-Asset-Tags.ps1 - recently we changed the way we're doing assets tags in Azure.  This script finds Asset Tag A and adds Asset Tag B to all assets that match.  This script is interactive.

Add-Bilateral-NSG-Rules.ps1 This script writes an inbound and outbound rule allowing bi-lateral traffic.  This works very well for environments that are locked down (like mine).
